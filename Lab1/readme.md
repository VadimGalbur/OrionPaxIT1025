# Executive Summary 
The main purpose of Lab 1 is to get a better understanding about what exactly course IT 1025 is, examine the history of computing and set up our own GitHub. IT1025 helps us to have a better idea about computing world and how it helps us in daily basis, it also covers a wide-range of computing topics that helps to determine student passions. IT history has many interesting facts. For example the one is explaining that GitHub are so useful now a days and help us to create, update and maintain any type of file and work in a special organized environment.

# Information System Components
Information systems hardware is the part of an information system you can touch – the physical components of the technology. Computers, keyboards, disk drives, iPads, and flash drives are all examples of information systems hardware.
Software is a set of instructions that tells the hardware what to do. Software is not tangible – it cannot be touched. When programmers create software programs, what they are really doing is simply typing out lists of instructions that tell the hardware what to do. There are several categories of software, with the two main categories being operating-system software, which makes the hardware usable, and application software, which does something useful. Examples of operating systems include Microsoft Windows on a personal computer and Google’s Android on a mobile phone. 
The third component is data. You can think of data as a collection of facts. For example, your street address, the city you live in, and your phone number are all pieces of data. Like software, data is also intangible. By themselves, pieces of data are not really very useful. But aggregated, indexed, and organized together into a database, data can become a powerful tool for businesses. In fact, all of the definitions presented at the beginning of this chapter focused on how information systems manage data. Organizations collect all kinds of data and use it to make decisions. These decisions can then be analyzed as to their effectiveness and the organization can be improved. 
People are consists of those who are able to use both software and hardware together to have a certain outcome.
Process is the way how to perform something with the help of software and hardware together to achieve certain outcome out of it.
In this five major component there is another hidden small components that joins together and makes it work in systematic manner that provide and share the information to achieve certain goals.for example.networking,server,clients etc.

# Client - Server Architecture
Client side development is done almost exclusively in JavaScript. This is, of course, in addition to basic HTML and CSS code. The reason JavaScript is called a client side language is because it runs scripts on your computer after you’ve loaded a web page.
A server side or back-end language runs its scripts before the HTML is loaded, not after.
There are a range of server side languages in use on the web today. PHP is one of the most popular, as well as Ruby on Rails, ASP.NET and many others. They are called server side languages because their scripts are run not on your computer, but on the server which hosts the website and sends down the HTML code.
Most websites make use of both a client side and a server side language. Although there are things both can do, there are some things which can only be done server side, and there are some things which can only be done client side.
Front-end scripting is good for anything that requires user interaction, such as a simple game. Back-end scripting is good for anything that requires dynamic data to be loaded, such as a notice that tells the user they’re logged in.
# Cloud Computing
GitHub is a cloud-based Git server for code hosting and social coding, and that it implements features for code review (pull requests, diffs, and review requests), project management (including issue tracking and assignment), integrations with other developer tools, team management, and documentation.
GitHub is at heart a Git repository hosting service, i.e. a cloud-based source code management or version control system, but that’s just the beginning. In addition, GitHub implements features for code review (pull requests, diffs, and review requests), project management (including issue tracking and assignment), integrations with other developer tools, team management, documentation, and “social coding.”
Something like a social networking site for programmers, GitHub is an open environment where programmers can freely share and collaborate (even ad hoc) on open source code. GitHub makes it easy to find useful code, copy repositories for your own use, and submit changes to others’ projects. As a result, GitHub has become home to virtually every open source project of any importance.

# Conclusion

Through the course of this lab I learned about the course requirements for IT1025 as well as an overview of client-server architecture and GitHub.  I found GitHub to be interesting but initially had difficulty creating a respoitory.  I revisited the process but was still stumped so I contacted my instructor and with a few pointers was then able to complete the process successfully. I look forward to spending more time on GitHub and eventually learning about database which I believe is my current IT passion.
